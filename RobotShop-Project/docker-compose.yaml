###################################################################

#In this Docker Compose file, logging defines how each container writes and stores its logs.
#Docker supports different log drivers, and here the driver used is:

#✔ json-file log driver

#This means Docker stores container logs in JSON format on the host machine, typically under:

#/var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>/<container-id>-json.log

# Breakdown of the logging section

#You have this at the top under mongodb:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: "json-file"
#  options:
#    max-size: "25m"
#    max-file: "2"
#✔ What this means:
#1. &logging – YAML Anchor

#This creates a reusable reference called logging.

#Instead of repeating the same logging configuration for every service, you define it once.

#2. driver: "json-file"

#This tells Docker to use its default log driver:

#Stores logs in a JSON file.

#Logs can be viewed using:

#docker logs <container-name>

#3. options

#These control log rotation.

#max-size: "25m"

#Each log file will be rotated when it reaches 25 megabytes.

#max-file: "2"

#Docker will keep 2 log files (1 active + 1 old).

#Prevents disk from filling up.

#🔄 How it's reused in other services

#Example:

#logging:
#  <<: *logging


#This is a YAML alias, referencing the anchor defined earlier.

#It means:
#"Use the same logging configuration defined for mongodb."

#So all containers get the same logging settings without duplication.

# Summary
#########
#✔ logging defines:

#Which log driver Docker uses

#How logs are stored

#Log rotation settings (limit size & number of files)

#✔ YAML Features Used:

#&logging = Anchor (define once)

#*logging = Reference (reuse anywhere)

#<<: = Merge with the anchor

#If you want, I can also show you how to:
#✔ change logs to local driver
#✔ send logs to ELK / Loki / CloudWatch
#✔ disable logs for specific containers

#✅ 1. Use a better log driver: local (recommended)

#local is better than json-file because it compresses old logs and saves disk space.

#Example:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: local
#  options:
#    max-size: "20m"
#    max-file: "3"

#✔ Saves more space
#✔ Faster log writes
#✔ Docker’s recommended driver for local logs

#✅ 2. Send Logs to Amazon CloudWatch

#If you're using AWS, CloudWatch is the best choice.

#Example:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: awslogs
#  options:
#    awslogs-region: ap-south-1
#    awslogs-group: robot-shop-logs
#    awslogs-create-group: "true"
#    awslogs-stream: "container-{{.Name}}"

#Requirements:

#EC2/ECS/IAM role must allow CloudWatch logs:
#logs:CreateLogGroup, logs:CreateLogStream, logs:PutLogEvents

#✅ 3. Send logs to Loki (Grafana)

#For Kubernetes-like logging on Docker.

#Example:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: loki
#  options:
#    loki-url: "http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
#    loki-batch-size: "400KB"

#Works well with Grafana dashboards.

#✅ 4. Send logs to ELK (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)

#Docker supports log driver: gelf

#Example:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: gelf
#  options:
#    gelf-address: "udp://logstash:12201"

#Use if you have a central ELK stack.

#✅ 5. Disable logging for specific containers

#If a container is too noisy:

#Example:

#logging:
#  driver: "none"

#🔄 How to apply these to all containers?

#You already have this pattern:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: local
#  options:
#    max-size: "20m"
#    max-file: "3"

#Then for each service:

#logging:
#  <<: *logging

#Perfect.

#👉 Where do you want your Docker container logs to be stored?

#Choose one option:

#1️⃣ Local log storage (simple, default)

#Logs stored on your server with rotation
#→ Good for small deployments or testing

#2️⃣ AWS CloudWatch

#Centralized logs, searchable, alerts
#→ Best if you’re on AWS (EC2, ECS, EKS)

#3️⃣ Grafana Loki

#Modern, efficient, Kubernetes-style logging
#→ Best if you're running monitoring dashboards

#4️⃣ ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)

#Powerful but heavy
#→ Best for enterprise search & analytics

#5️⃣ No logs

#You want to disable logs for some containers
#→ Useful for noisy or debug containers

#Here is the complete collection of logging setups:

#✅ 1️⃣ LOCAL LOG STORAGE (Recommended Default)

#Uses Docker’s local driver — saves disk space, rotates logs, compresses old logs.

#Use this in your compose file:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: local
#  options:
#    max-size: "20m"
#    max-file: "3"

#Apply to services

#logging:
#  <<: *logging

#✅ 2️⃣ AWS CLOUDWATCH LOGGING (Best for AWS)

#Use this if your Docker host is on EC2, EKS worker node, or AWS server.

#CloudWatch Logging Config:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: awslogs
#  options:
#    awslogs-region: ap-south-1
#    awslogs-group: robot-shop-logs
#    awslogs-stream: "{{.Name}}"
#    awslogs-create-group: "true"


#AWS Requirements

#IAM role or key must allow:
#logs:CreateLogGroup, logs:CreateLogStream, logs:PutLogEvents

#✅ 3️⃣ LOKI + GRAFANA LOGGING

#Perfect if you use Loki + Promtail + Grafana dashboard.

#Loki Logging Config:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: loki
#  options:
#    loki-url: "http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
#    loki-batch-size: "400KB"
#    loki-timeout: "10s"

#You must have a Loki container or Loki server available.

#✅ 4️⃣ ELK STACK LOGGING (ELASTICSEARCH + LOGSTASH + KIBANA)

#Docker uses the gelf driver for sending logs to Logstash.

#ELK Logging Config:

#logging: &logging
#  driver: gelf
#  options:
#    gelf-address: "udp://logstash:12201"
#    tag: "{{.Name}}"


#Configure Logstash input:

#input {
#  gelf {
#    port => 12201
#  }
#}

#✅ 5️⃣ DISABLE LOGGING (For noisy or non-critical containers)
#Disable logging completely:

#logging:
#  driver: none


#Useful for:

#Debug containers

#Containers generating huge logs

#Temporary workloads

#🔄 How to switch between them?

#You only replace the anchor at the top:

#Example:

# Option 1: Local logs
#logging: &logging
#  driver: local
#  options:
#    max-size: "20m"
#    max-file: "3"

# OR Option 2: CloudWatch
#logging: &logging
#  driver: awslogs
#  options:
#    ...
#Then everything below stays the same:

#logging:
#  <<: *logging


# Bonus Recommendation

#For production:



#| Platform                  | Best Logging Option |
#| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
#| **AWS EC2/EKS**           | CloudWatch          |
#| **Local Server**          | Local (default)     |
#| **Monitoring dashboards** | Loki                |
#| **Heavy analytics**       | ELK                 |
#| **Small lab/dev**         | Local               |
